## Who is this guy?

Hello there, I'm Ariel Pab√≥n (or Floof, if we're using made up names).

I'm a Software Engineer who likes furries, drawing and math.

## Projects

If you wish, you can take a look at the **featured repositories**. These are probably the most interesting ones, after all.

You can also take a look at my [old GitHub account](https://github.com/lyca22)!
